## About Me

Hello, I'm **Yutaka Nagashima** (**Ng** for short). It's great to meet you! 
I'm a **scientist** passionate about making theorem proving more accessible and performant. 

Let me share a bit about myself.

I was born to and raised by a Japanese family in [**Yokosuka**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yokosuka), a port city in Kanagawa Prefecture, **Japan**. 

Yokosuka holds a significant place in Japanese history, as it was near here that [Commodore **Matthew Perry**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_C._Perry) of the United States Navy arrived in 1853. 
This event marked a turning point in Japan's history, eventually leading to the end of the [**Tokugawa Shogunate**](https://www.visit-hokkaido.jp/en/) in 1868 and the beginning of the **Meiji Restoration**. 
Yokosuka currently hosts the largest US Navy base in Asia. 

Despite the city's international background, I grew up in a monolingual environment and attended public schools from elementary through high school. I kept my aspirations for foreign experiences close to my heart while learning English through the radio.

My maternal family is from a northern island called [**Hokkaido**](https://www.visit-hokkaido.jp/en/). Hokkaido typically falls into the humid continental climate classification, offering a refuge from the heat and humidity in summer, and winter sports in winter, while most of Japan is classified as subtropical.

I used to visit one of the southernmost cities of Hokkaido, [**Hakodate**](https://www.hakodate.travel/en/), every summer and winter during my childhood. Hakodate was also a city of military significance in the past, with the star-shaped [**Goryokaku** Fort](https://www.goryokaku-tower.co.jp/en/history/), which served as a battlefield during the Meiji Restoration. Nowadays, the fort is used as a park and serves as a tourist destination.

Hokkaido was originally inhabited by the [**Ainu** people](https://ainu-upopoy.jp/en/ainu-culture/), who have distinct cultural backgrounds. The island’s economic development was delayed, and it still faces significant financial struggles evnen with its rich tourism resources. Despite the challenges ahead, I consider the **artlessness** of the northern island as another of its charms, along with its **European-style landscapes** and **seafood**.

## My Journey
Currently, I'm working as a **scientist** at the **Czech Academy of Sciences in Prague**. 
My path has taken me from Yokosuka to various parts of the world, including:
- **Huawei Technologies R&D** in Cambridge, UK 🇬🇧
- [**Yale-NUS College**](https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg) in Singapore 🇸🇬
- [**Czech Technical University in Prague**](https://www.cvut.cz/en/), Czechia 🇨🇿
- [**Data61, CSIRO**](https://www.csiro.au/en/about/people/business-units/Data61) in Sydney, Australia 🇦🇺
- [**NICTA (National ICT Australia)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NICTA) in Sydney, Australia 🇦🇺
- **L&T Engineering Solutions** in Vadodara, India 🇮🇳

## Educational Background
I completed my PhD in Computer Science at the [**Leopold-Franzens Universität Innsbruck**](https://www.uibk.ac.at/en/) in Austria, where I studied in the [**Computational Logic**](http://cl-informatik.uibk.ac.at) group. (🇦🇹). 

Prior to that, I obtained my Master's degree in Computational Science and Engineering from the [**Technische Universität München**](https://www.tum.de/en/) in Munich, Germany (🇩🇪).

My Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering and Electronics is from [**Sophia University**](https://www.sophia.ac.jp/eng/) in Tokyo, Japan (🇯🇵). 

While pursuing my undergraduate studies, I also visited countries such as Guatemala (🇬🇹), China (🇨🇳), and the Philippines (🇵🇭) during holidays, which remain some of the most memorable periods of my life.

Pro tip: I tend to be slow in responding. 
Please don’t take a delayed reply as a sign that you’re not important. 
It often means I’m carefully considering your message, I’m offline, focused on something else, or I may have simply not noticed it.
If you need a quick response, please indicate the urgency by stating "URGENT" in the subject line of your email or at the beginning of your message. 
That being said, I’d appreciate it if you could avoid this unless necessary, as I’m often juggling deadlines.
