## Podcast-like Paper-review Series

The following playlists showcase relevant papers on theorem proving in a podcast-style format featuring AI avatars. In each video, the AI avatars discuss key research findings, challenges, limitations, and negative lessons learned during the projects, as well as future plans to address these issues. The discussions are delivered in a more informal style compared to the tone typically used in academic papers.

I also aim to present these podcasts in multiple languages to overcome language barriers. While I take basic measures to accurately represent the work and avoid harmful or incorrect connotations, English, Spanish, and Chinese are not my native languages. If you notice any problematic expressions, I would greatly appreciate your constructive feedback.

At the moment, I’m introducing papers I co-authored as the lead author.
If you have a peer-reviewed academic paper on theorem proving, AI, programming languages, computer architecture, or CPU design, and would like it to be included in the series, let me know.
