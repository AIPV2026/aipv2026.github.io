# Call for Sponsorship

AIPV collocated with [FM 2026](https://conf.researchr.org/home/fm-2026) | May 18–19, 2026 (exact workshop date TBA) |  Tokyo, Japan

## AI, Proof and Verification (AIPV)

We kindly invite companies, research organizations, and academic/industrial partners to consider supporting the 1st International Workshop on AI, Proof and Verification (AIPV).

AIPV aims to build a bridge between:
- AI / Machine Learning (including LLMs),
- Theorem proving and formal verification,
- Safety-critical and high-assurance system development.

The workshop provides a unique forum for dialogue between communities that rarely meet under one roof, fostering new collaborations and advancing trustworthy reasoning technologies.

Your support will help us:
- maintain low participation barriers,
- enable travel support for invited speakers,
- facilitate tool demonstrations and student engagement.

## Sponsorship Opportunities

To keep things simple and approachable for our first edition, we offer three levels of sponsorship:

Tier | Contribution | Benefits
**Supporter** | JPY 50,000 (≈ USD 330) | Logo on website + acknowledgement during the opening
**Contributor** | JPY 150,000 (≈ USD 1,000) | Supporter benefits + organization description and links on website
**Partner** | JPY 300,000 (≈ USD 2,000) | Contributor benefits + optional demo table or short organization introduction (schedule and space permitting)

If these levels do not match your organization’s policy, we are happy to discuss custom options (e.g., JPY 100,000, JPY 200,000, JPY 500,000).
Even small contributions are welcome and appreciated.

## Why Sponsor AIPV 2026?

- Access to **talent** (students, postdocs, experienced researchers)
- Engagement with experts working on **trustworthy AI, safety/security, and rigorous verification**

- Invited speaker registration/travel/accommodation,
- Student support for attending and presenting,
- Logistics enabling tool/demo sessions,
